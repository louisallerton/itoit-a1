*Louis Allerton RMIT ITOIT Assessment 1*  
  
This is a space for me to express my interest in IT and begin to build a 'Personal Profile'.   
I can reflect on this content and what I learned to help make future career choices.  


With that in mind, I'm here for a good time and will participate in any exciting project with deligence.  
Not the kind to rest at the peak, I'm gonna make a mark.

### What You'll Find Here:

- A bit [about myself][about] some of the things that make me tick.
- A project idea of mine.
- My ideal job in the IT industry.
